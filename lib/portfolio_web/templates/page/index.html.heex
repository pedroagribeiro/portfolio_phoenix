    <p class="text-lg font-semibold pb-10">Hello there, I am Pedro Ribeiro! ðŸ‘‹ </p>
    <p>I am a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> based in Braga. I am currently studying at <strong>University of
      Minho</strong> where I am wrapping up my <strong>Masters Degree</strong> in <strong>Distributed Systems &
      Application Engineering</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>I really like to come up with scalable and responsive application architectures that allow for a growth proof
      deployment and therefore a better user experience. I'm also really into the <strong>DevOps</strong> culture since I
      like to automate every task I can.
    </p>
    <p>Lately I've been dabbling with <strong>Graphic Design</strong> and <strong>Photography</strong> so stay tuned, I
      might drop some new work soon!
    </p>
